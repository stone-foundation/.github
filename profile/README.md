## What is the Stone Foundation?

The **Stone Foundation** is a non-profit organization dedicated to advancing the future of universal, context-aware software development.

We build tools, share knowledge, and support a global community of developers around a simple but radical idea:

> **Context defines everything.**  
> Software should be flexible, composable, and able to adapt to any environment, without rewriting your logic every time.

We believe in empowering developers to write once, run anywhere, cloud, browser, edge, server, or serverless, with clarity and joy.

## What is Stone.js?

**Stone.js** is a next-generation JavaScript & TypeScript framework that allows you to:

- Build **backend**, **frontend**, **CLI**, **SSR**, or **fullstack** apps
- Deploy **anywhere**: Node, browser, AWS Lambda, edge, container…
- Use **modern JavaScript**, decorators, ES Modules, and zero-dependency builds
- Embrace both **declarative (class)** and **imperative (function)** APIs
- Follow the **Continuum Architecture**: one unified way to reason across dimensions
